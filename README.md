# SquidOS
This is a UEFI Operating System that I'm making for fun and to learn more about UEFI OS development. I have previously tried to make two operating systems and I learned a lot by messing aroung in them.

# What I'm planning to add
 I will add a lot of features hopefully, but for now I'm planning to add:
  * Memory Management and Allocation
  * A Working Command Line Interface
  * More Graphics Functionality
  * A Better String Class
  * More Maths Functions
  * Mouse Functionality
  * Sound
  * Access (Accounts and Passwords)
  * GUI (Probably Not For A While)
  
 # What Inspired Me To Make This
 I have been facinated with programming for a large part of my life, but ever since I stumbled on C++ I have been interested in low level programming, OS development is the pinnicle of low level. I'm not attempting to make the next Windows or Linux, I'm just trying to have a good time and pick up some skills along the way.
 
 # Why SquidOS
 Because I'm bad at names and that was the first thing that came into my head. Also because Squids are cool.
 
 # Mentions
 I have been following a YouTube series by [Poncho](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxN4E629pPnJxCQCLy7E0SQY_zuumOVyZ) on Youtube, [@AbsurdPoncho](https://github.com/absurdponcho/) on GitHub and I've found it extremely helpful and informative.
 
 # Copyright
 I have no copyright on this operating system, feel free to use my code wherever you want. Let me know where you're using it, I'd love to know.
